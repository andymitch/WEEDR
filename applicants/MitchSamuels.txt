Frontend-focused web developer with a passion for design. I have experience working
with Angular, React, Django, Python, Go, MEAN stack, jQuery, and countless other
frontend and backend frameworks and tools, but I spend most of my time fighting with
HTML, Javascript, and CSS/SASS/LESS.
PROJECTS
ineedaresu.me
Mar 2015
A dead-simple resume generator that lets you create a
resume in minutes. Built on AngularJS using
local storage to save user data. The generator creates a
well-designed resume that is printable or can be
downloaded as a PDF.
Ceev.io
February 2018
This is my latest project - basically a re-do of
ineedaresu.me since I sold that and no longer have
access to it. Ceev makes creating resumes insanely
simple on any device. Users can save their resumes to
access anywhere, and the webapp offers a ton of
customization options to create an awesome resume.
Open Source Electron Apps
December 2017
I have a few open-source Electron desktop apps
available on my GitHub @mitchas. They're tools that
I've created because they're tools I wanted to use, so I
developed them and released the source. One is a
floating transparent web browser, and another is a
super minimal FTP client.
